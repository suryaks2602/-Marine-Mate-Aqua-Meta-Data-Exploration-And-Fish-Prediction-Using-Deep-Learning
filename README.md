# Marine-Mate-Aqua-Metadata-Exploration-And-Fish-Species-Prediction-Using-Deep-Learning.
For the past decade Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming a beneficial 
part for most. Starting from entertainment to productivity AI can’t be 
missed out. Similarly, India is showcasing its own growth in a whole new 
genre. Thus, utilizing marine resources wisely will also be a crucial part 
for highly emerging economy since most of the parts are costal in nature. 
Despite the fact, analyzing the ocean and its environment still remains 
unexplored which brings a halfway impossible situation to protect 
endangered species or to classify such species.  Our project is web based 
and it uses moderate AI interacting tool the website can also detect the 
species of fish using “ABH fish prediction” and additional information, 
Meta data and ideology of southern India that initially starts from Chennai. 
Our project provides data regarding oceanography, seabound geographic, 
aquaculture, sea surface temperature, PH level and basic web sites that you 
can visit and get knowledge about fishing zone, minerals, etc. Our 
progressing project will aim to give a detail description about ocean and 
its necessary information in a single platform.
